**Project-1** : 
**SIR model**: 
The **SIR model** (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) is a fundamental mathematical model used in epidemiology to describe the spread of infectious diseases. It divides a population into three compartments: **Susceptible (S)** individuals who can contract the disease, **Infectious (I)** individuals who have the disease and can spread it, and **Recovered (R)** individuals who have recovered and gained immunity. The model is governed by differential equations that describe the rate of change in each compartment based on parameters like transmission and recovery rates. It helps in predicting disease outbreaks, evaluating control strategies, and understanding herd immunity dynamics.
