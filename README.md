**Project-1** : 
**SIR model**: 
The **SIR model** (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) is a fundamental mathematical model used in epidemiology to describe the spread of infectious diseases. It divides a population into three compartments: **Susceptible (S)** individuals who can contract the disease, **Infectious (I)** individuals who have the disease and can spread it, and **Recovered (R)** individuals who have recovered and gained immunity. The model is governed by differential equations that describe the rate of change in each compartment based on parameters like transmission and recovery rates. It helps in predicting disease outbreaks, evaluating control strategies, and understanding herd immunity dynamics.

**Project-2** : 

**Optical Fiber Simualtion**:
**Optical fiber** is a thin, flexible strand of glass or plastic that transmits light signals over long distances with minimal loss, making it essential for high-speed telecommunications. It operates on the principle of **total internal reflection**, allowing light to propagate through the fiber core. In **single-mode fiber (SMF)**, which is widely used in telecom networks, the core diameter is typically around **8-10 Âµm**, allowing only one mode of light to travel, reducing dispersion and ensuring high data transmission rates. Key attributes include the **numerical aperture (NA)**, which defines the fiber's light-gathering ability, and the **refractive index**, where the core has a slightly higher index than the cladding to maintain light confinement. Standard telecom fibers, like **ITU-T G.652**, have a core refractive index around **1.45**, and an NA of approximately **0.12**, optimizing performance for long-distance communication.
