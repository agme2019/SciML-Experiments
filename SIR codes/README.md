## üìã Overview

This repository contains a collection of experiments applying the Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework to the classic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic model. The code demonstrates how differential equation solvers and machine learning techniques can be combined to simulate, analyze, and predict disease dynamics.

## ü¶† About SIR Models

The SIR model is a fundamental compartmental model in epidemiology that divides a population into three groups:

- **S**usceptible: Individuals who can contract the disease
- **I**nfected: Individuals who have the disease and can spread it
- **R**ecovered: Individuals who have recovered and developed immunity

The interactions between these compartments are governed by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

## üî¨ Experiments

This repository includes:

1. **Basic SIR Implementation** - Classic SIR model implementation using Julia's DifferentialEquations.jl
2. **Parameter Estimation** - Techniques for estimating transmission and recovery rates from data
3. **Stochastic Variants** - SIR models with random fluctuations to capture real-world uncertainty
4. **Neural-Enhanced Models** - Using neural networks to enhance traditional SIR models

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Julia 1.8 or higher
- SciML packages (instructions below)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/agme2019/SciML-Experiments.git
cd SciML-Experiments/SIR\ codes/

# Install required packages
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()'
```

### Running the Examples

Each experiment is contained in its own Julia file. To run an experiment:

```bash
julia path/to/experiment.jl
```

## üìä Example Results

The SIR model simulations produce time-series data showing the progression of an epidemic:

```
Time    Susceptible    Infected    Recovered
0.0     999            1           0
5.0     905            85          10
10.0    463            367         170
...
```
